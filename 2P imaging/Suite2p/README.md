# Cell detection criteria
In order to ensure a standardised approach to cell detection, these criteria should be adhered to when doing a manual curation of the ROIs detected by suite2p:
- ROIs which have a reasonable shape (and also look similar to the actual recording)
- fast responses
- neuropil traces and raw fluroescence activity should not be similar (as little correlation between traces as possible)
- as few slow responses as possible (beware of traces which only have slow responses, especially if they are present near a blood vessel)
- be especially careful with ROIs detected on/below or near blood vessels (dark areas)
