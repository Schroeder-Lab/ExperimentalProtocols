##About and good to know:
###What is Bonvision?
Bonvision is a community package which can be installed in Bonsai and allows creating diverse visual stimuli protocols
**Most important thing to remember: Bosai is asynchronous, unlike Python, Matlab etc**
**Further resources:**
There is a Bonvision website which more or less describes what it does, how it works and the different nodes such as DrawQuad, DrawGratings etc (scroll down on the about page for a useful youtube tutorial video)
