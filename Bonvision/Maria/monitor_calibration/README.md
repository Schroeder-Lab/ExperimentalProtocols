# Monitor calibration

## This page explains how to perform monitor calibration for the monitors we use to show visual stimuli to the experimental animals.

### Why calibrating the monitor?

### Part 1: Monitor calibration test
- Before we can calibrate the monitor we first need to determine what the current colour correction is
- for this we need to measure what the monitor displays using a photodiode
- this is present in the current setup (December 2021)
- There is a Bonvision script for this
